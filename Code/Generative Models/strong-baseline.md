The colab notebook StrongBaseline - CharRNN.ipynb is divided into 3 sections - 

1. Data Preprocessing is done in the first section of the Colab - StrongBaseline - CharRNN.ipynb

2. Second section is the Implementation:
> To run, simply run the implementation cells of CharRNN using the following preprocessed data file:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s6vrO0qh2F2xtFdqXLhTi2f36XumQYb1/view?usp=sharing
> Tune hyperparameters and run the model in the last cell of the Implementation section

3. The last section is used for formatting the output of the model for evaluation of haikus using GRUEN.
