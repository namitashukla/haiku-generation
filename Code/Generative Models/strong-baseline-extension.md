The colab notebook strong-baseline-extension-Character_Syllable_RNN.ipynb is divided into 5 sections - 

# Notebook understanding 

1. **Installs and Setup** - the required libraries and functions  
2. **Data Preprocessing** - with the preprocessed data we convert it into required structure for the network
3. **Network implementation** - Pytorch implementation of the CharSyllable RNN Network 
4. **Train** - Code for training the model and hyper-parameter tuning
5. **Predict** - The generator function to finally "generate" more movies. 


The idea is to simply run the notebook - comments and annotations are provided for ease of understanding.
